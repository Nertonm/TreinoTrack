[{"type":"Strength","name":"Barbell Squat","description":"This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack to just below shoulder level. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it. \nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. \nStep away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section). Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and hips as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. \nContinue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement.","sets":"3","reps":"12","weight":"0.0"},{"type":"Hike","name":"Corrida","description":"Cordia","duration":"120.0"}]
